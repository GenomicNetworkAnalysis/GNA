Welcome to the GNA GitHub!
- GNA is an R package for performing network analysis of genetic overlap derived from GWAS summary statistics
- See the GNA [Wiki](https://github.com/GenomicNetworkAnalysis/GNA/wiki) for details on installing and running GNA
- Open a [Discussion](https://github.com/GenomicNetworkAnalysis/GNA/discussions) if you have any questions about GNA, have trouble getting the package to work etc.
- Raise an [Issue](https://github.com/GenomicNetworkAnalysis/GNA/issues) if you have found a bug in GNA code
- Refer to the original GNA [manuscript](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.12.03.24318432v1) for more information about the method
